            <p class="display-3 d-inline">1.</p>
            <p class="display-5 d-inline">Kamelot</p>
            <p class="lead border-bottom py-4"> A prog metal band surprisingly from Florida US. I say this because most of this genres hails from from Europe.
                In there d efence, the singer is Swedish. Their albums always cover some topic like the Afterlife, Loss of a loved one, Fantasy creatrues like wearwolves
                and vampires. Both singers they have had have such amazing voices! And the music is top notch. 
                Only complaint would be the drums can be heavy in the "Blast beats" department, but that is a curse of the whole genre.</p>

        <div class="col-12 display-5 text-center">
    
            <p class="display-3 d-inline">2.</p>
            <p class="display-5 d-inline">311</p>
            <p class="lead border-bottom py-4"> This band came out while I was in highschool and when for most of us, music becomes a huge part of our lives like oxygen and food and girls of course.
                Who hasn't made a mixed tape for a girl, or lust laid back on their bed, eyes closed with headphones on and volume at 100%? 311 mixed a funky beat, fun lyrics and their own brand of "RAP/ROCK" that was just begining to emerge.
                They said it best when they sais "We are first in a sea of replicas" They are a very versitile band that is still making new music to this day, 30ish years later!</p>

            <p class="display-3 d-inline">3.</p>
            <p class="display-5 d-inline">GUNSHIP</p>
            <p class="lead border-bottom py-4">Imagine what it would be like if the 80s came back, but with modern computers behind those synth sounds? You would get synthwave. A fairly new genre.
                GUNSHIP, yes it requires all caps, is one of the few groups in this genre that I konw of that have a lead singer and vocals on every track. I love listening to there stuff
                when I am working on game and web dev. Something baout the sound just makes me feel more at one with my computer!</p>

            <p class="display-3 d-inline">4.</p>
            <p class="display-5 d-inline">Megadeth</p>
            <p class="lead border-bottom py-4">I may not get into the heavier stuff as much these day, blame it on settling down or something, but I still have fond memories
                of blasting these guys in my little Honda Prelude as me and the boys drove back and forth for hours on end. I loved their guitar sound, the 
                solos, the lyrics. It fit well with my teen angst and with my stereo as well! I can actually atribute some of my hearing loss to this band.</p>

        <div class="col-12 display-5 text-center">
    
            <p class="display-3 d-inline">5.</p>
            <p class="display-5 d-inline">Pink Floyd</p>
            <p class="lead border-bottom py-4">There are so many bands that I have loved over the years and I certainly could keep going with more and maybe make a top 10, but we will stop at 5 with 
                Pink Floyd. I am not the only one who really enjoys this band. For a group that started out as a motion picture sound track band, they really came into 
                their own when they atarted making music. It was a bit rough in the early years where they sounded like they were imitating The Beatles a bit too much,
                but I also think many bands wanted to ride that wave back then. Their most iconic stuff takes you to another place, and is always 
                something you can put on, kick back and just enjoy.</p>

            <p class="display-5 d-inline">Honorable Mentions</p>
            <p class="lead border-bottom py-4">Although I am stopping at a top 5, I do want to just list a few more honorable mentions as I honestly love music a lot and have enjoyed music from almost every 
                genre there is! Weezer, Pantera, Garth Brooks, George Straight, Steve Miller Band, Journey, Styx, 2Pac, Bone Thugs in Harmony, Skid Row, and on and on and on.</p>
