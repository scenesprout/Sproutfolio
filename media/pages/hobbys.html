                I am an avid gamer. Not only do I love the games, but I also love the technology behind them.
                I have collected most of the systems over the years with vast libraries. Although I parted ways with quite a few of them early on,
                I have been recollecting some of my more favorites as a way to reconnect with and experience them all over again.

            <p class="lead">
                As I am sure many people can say, I have loved music from a very young age. I played piano for 11 years and enjoyed it quite a lot. Although when I
                graduated from High School I lost touch with it. I did pick up guitar for a while and from time to time I still play with both. It has become a goal
                of mine to try and pick them both back up on in a more serious manor. Music has helped me through the hard times and made the good times more memorable. 
                Crank your fave tunes to 11 if music has brought you joy!

            <p class="lead">
                The lights go down, the volumne goes up. The subwoofers rumble and that opening scene begins! The hero stares out across an open landscape as he ponders the adventure ahead.
                Or a car speeds by followed by more cars with loud sirens and bright blue and red flashing lights. Two men in the back seat yell to the man in the drivers seat, "Move your ass man! I won't let htme take me alive!"
                Can you smell the popcorn yet? Movies are amazing! For a few hours you are transported to other worlds. Taken on an adventure or told a story that makes your heart melt, your mind ponder, or your face weep.
                How many times have you watched your fave movie and that one scene still maeks you want to jump up and put and head out on an adventure or take your car for a spin? I love movies so much I even enjoy the ones most people consider bad!

            <p class="lead">
                My love of technology have been around since I was young. Computers and video games have been a constant source of entertainment and fasination. 
                But the two first pieces of tech that I remember owning, and oneof my first words was, Calculator and a Camera. Photography was something I loved from a very young age, but with the price of film,
                flash bulbs and processing those photos, it was not something my parents could support the way I wanted. It wouldn't be until I made "adult money" that I was able to picck up the hobby. 
                Sure there where cameras in early smart phones but I was not inspired by the images these teeny tiny little lenses and sensors created. Not 
                to mention that they were heavily processed by the software built into the phone. They were ok for what it was but nothing that really grabbed me and 
                pushed me to chase it as a passion. When I purchased my first DSL, a Nikon d3200, I took over 3000 photos the first year just figuring it all out. 
                Some of those photos will be featured in the gallery linked below. I would go on to upgrade my camera to a d7200 then switch cameras systems all together 
                with a Sony A7R IV full frame camera. All in all I have 3 cameras for photos and several for video including one that is a handheld 
                gimbal video camera. The technology is amazing and I absolutly love the hobby.
